# Free day
Free day is a free software project that aims to create a microservice with which to know the holidays of different parts of the world.

## Objective
We will build a REST API to make easier to know if it's holidays in any part of the world.
The idea is that anyone can post the holidays day their country, state or city.

## Why this project?
I've been thinking and looking around and there's nothing like Free day. Let's say you are building a service that needs to know
if it's holiday on the country that it's running for some purpose. You don't need to hardcode the holidays, just use an API and get the holidays
of any part of the world: country, state or city. And the fact that anyone can contribute makes. Very usefull for the interational commerce.
Free day unique and with a great growing potential.
