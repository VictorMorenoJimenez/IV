# Toolbelt

* [Node](https://nodejs.org/es/): Node.js has been choosen for this project because it's a perfect
solution for API development. With a big community behind and the perfect armony between simplicity and performance.
* [Express](http://expressjs.com/): Fast minimalist web framework for Node.js. Express for the backend has become the standart
server framework for node.js. Express makes very easy to develop and application which can be used to handle any type of HTTP request.
Fits perfectly with FreeDay.
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/es): Database system NoSQL. It is document oriented and open source. Personally I choosed MongoDB because
I wanted to learn a NoSQL tool. Also MongoDB has a big community behind, and that's always a good sign when choosing a tool.
* [Fluentd](https://www.fluentd.org/): Nowadays a logging system is essential for any kind of application. Fluentd allows you 
to unify your data of your application. Every single service inside the application, logs to fluentd and fluentd manages and structures that data.
Open source, ofcourse.
* [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/): Testing JavaScript framework. Mocha is the most popular test tool for JavaScript. I`ve been trying some other alternatives like Jasmine but Mocha has proved to be simplest and more effective.
* [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/): Assertion Library. Fits good with Mocha.
* [Docker & Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/deploying-with-docker): Deploying with Docker and Heroku.  Heroku is a cloud platform
as a service (PaaS) that supports several programming languages. Heroku supports Node.js so fits good with this application. Also Heroku integrates perfectly with Docker. Docker is a set of platform as a service (PaaS) products that use OS level virtualization. Docker offers us the possibility of separating our application in different containers, ensuring modularization and isolating the different services from the application. Both Heroku and Docker are open source.
* [Travis CI](https://github.com/VictorMorenoJimenez/IV/blob/master/docs/travisci.md): Continuous integration. More information on link.
* [Circle CI](https://github.com/VictorMorenoJimenez/IV/blob/master/docs/circleci.md). Continuous integration. More information on link.
